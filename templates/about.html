        Beat This Together is the student face for Beat (the UKâ€™s largest eating disorder charity) at the
        University of Bristol. We participate in campaigning and fundraising for Beat, as well as running a range of
        educational and wellbeing events. This helps us to promote positive mental health and body image among our
        community, all while increasing the the conversation around eating disorders and weight stigma.</p>
